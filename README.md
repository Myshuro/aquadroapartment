This is a small project for a friend who owns two apartments that he rents out on the seaside in Italy.
https://aquadro-apartment.netlify.app/
The website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
It is hosted on Netlify and is connected to GitHub, so any changes committed from my local repository to GitHub are automatically reflected on the website.
There is also a small back-end component hosted on Render.com, which processes data from the form in the "BOOK WITH US" section and sends it to a specified email address.
One downside of the free tier on Render.com is that the app "sleeps" when not used for more than 15 minutes. So, if you want to try it out, please be patient, as it takes about one minute to wake up once it receives a request.
A small database is hosted on Supabase.com, which contains the availability and pricing of the apartments. This database is used to render and populate the "Availability" page.
