A small project for a friend that has apartments that can be rented on the seaside in Italy
https://aquadro-apartment.netlify.app/
HTML CSS Bootstrap JavaScript
It is hosted on netlify and it is connected to github so that any changes that are committed from my local repository to github are also visible on the website.
There is also a small back-end part that is hosted on render.com
A small database is hosted on supabase that contains the availability and pricing of the apartments, baseed on this the "Availability page is rendered and populated"
